<p>
My name is Melvin Karuga. I am currently a cybert security engineer. 
These are some of the things I have been working on.

This blog is meant to document my discoveres and progress; whether I am going through the steps of a techincal walkthrough, or analyzing my thoughts on a certain topic, 
I want this information to be all stored in one place so I can keep track of my own progress, but also showcase this to anyone interested.
