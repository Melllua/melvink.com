<p>Reading up on material and theory can be helpful, but there was only so much I was able to learn by studying network fundamentals and how vulerabilities are exploited.  I needed to actually go out and experiment with these concepts.  There are alternatives, such as tryhackme and hackthebox, but I wanted to also dig deeper; I wanted to create the simulation myself with an active directory, a domain controller, and an up and running server with users and administrators.  The aim was to simulate a real working environment, all with the help of VMware.</p>
